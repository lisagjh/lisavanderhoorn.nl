We had the chance to work directly with their team lead, Declan—an expert in his field. Each sprint review, he gave us valuable feedback, which really helped me grow as a developer.\n\nDeclan encouraged us to make some creative decisions of our own to improve the design, and I definitely took that opportunity. You can compare our version with the official one and see the differences—especially in the menu and the banner carousel on the homepage.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was designing the banner carousel in a way that all logos would look good. Honestly, I still prefer our version over the real one, since some logos in the official design are barely visible.\n\nFor the menu, I chose to move it into a sidebar rather than keeping it in the header. In the original design, they kind of cheated by using a super small font-size (around 12px), which I wasn’t a fan of. I believe accessibility and readability come first, so I looked for a better solution.\n\nAlong with the sidebar, I added a `view-transition` on the active state to make axtive state animation smoother. I also implemented scroll-driven animations on the homepage for a more dynamic experience.\n\nThe project was built using SvelteKit, shortly after the release of Svelte 5. At the time, we were just starting to learn how to work with JavaScript frameworks—so jumping straight into the newest version of Svelte was both exciting and a little overwhelming. It meant a steep learning curve, a lot of trial and error, and frequent refactoring as we learned better ways to structure and write our code.\n\nThat said, it also gave us a great opportunity to dive into some of the latest features right away. We quickly started working with the new \"Runes Mode\", using `$state` and `$derived`, combined with things like `$effect()`. Looking back, it was quite challenging, but also super rewarding.

Each week we got a new random prompt, focused on a certain new(-ish) feature or technology.\n\nThis week my prompt was \u003Cem>Glitzy Brutalist View Transitions\u003C/em>. I loved this prompt, since I have always been interested in brutalism, and instantly had some cool ideas of how to implement this into this website.\n\nI started out analysing the prompt. I did end up kind of ignoring the glitzy part, leaning into brutalism. So what does brutalism mean? In architecture it's raw materials, visible structure, and no unnecessary decorations. When you look at brutalism in webdesign, it tends to be mostly black and white, with one or two colors as accent, simple fonts, often big headings, minimal to no decorative elements.\n\nSo how do I translate this to a view transition? I decided to go big and bold, and created an interactive screen with `P5.js` and the \u003Ca href=\"https://p5-svelte.netlify.app/\">svelte library\u003C/a>.

I started small, adding an animated active state indicator to the menu item using the `::before` pseudo-element. To my surprise, it was super straightforward:\n\n```css\n.active::before {\n  view-transition-name: active-link;\n}\n```\n\nThat one line already gave me a nice animation between active links—way easier than I expected, and a fun first win before tackling the more complex stuff.\n\n\nOnce I got the hang of basic transitions, I deciced to dive into the transition I had in mind. I turned the interactive graphic into a component, and imported it in the `Layout.svelte`. Here I used a boolean variable called `isTransitioning` to toggle it's visibility during page transitions. This component fades in when a transition is happening, and fades out when it's done. It sits on top of everything with `position: fixed`. \n\nI used a boolean variable called `isTransitioning` to toggle its visibility during page transitions. This component fades in while a transition is happening and fades out when it’s done.

It turned out way better than I expected! \nThis is still one of my favourite projects I made in school.
