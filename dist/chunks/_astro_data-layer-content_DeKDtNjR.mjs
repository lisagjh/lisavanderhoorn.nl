It was a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.voorhoede.nl/nl/\">De Voorhoede</a>, who developed the actual new website for <a href=\"https://dutchdigitalagencies.com/\">Dutch Digital Agencies</a>. We had the chance to work directly with their team lead, Declan—an expert in his field. Each sprint review, he gave us valuable feedback, which really helped me grow as a developer.\n\nDeclan encouraged us to make some creative decisions of our own to improve the design, and I definitely took that opportunity. You can compare our version with the official one and see the differences—especially in the menu and the banner carousel on the homepage.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was designing the banner carousel in a way that all logos would look good. Honestly, I still prefer our version over the real one, since some logos in the official design are barely visible.\n\nFor the menu, I chose to move it into a sidebar rather than keeping it in the header. In the original design, they kind of cheated by using a super small font-size (around 12px), which I wasn’t a fan of. I believe accessibility and readability come first, so I looked for a better solution.\n\nAlong with the sidebar, I added a `view-transition` on the active state to make axtive state animation smoother. I also implemented scroll-driven animations on the homepage for a more dynamic experience.\n\nThe project was built using SvelteKit, shortly after the release of Svelte 5. At the time, we were just starting to learn how to work with JavaScript frameworks—so jumping straight into the newest version of Svelte was both exciting and a little overwhelming. It meant a steep learning curve, a lot of trial and error, and frequent refactoring as we learned better ways to structure and write our code.\n\nThat said, it also gave us a great opportunity to dive into some of the latest features right away. We quickly started working with the new \"Runes Mode\", using `$state` and `$derived`, combined with things like `$effect()`. Looking back, it was quite challenging, but also super rewarding.

Each week we got a new random prompt, focused on a certain new(-ish) feature or technology.\n\nThis week my prompt was <em>Glitzy Brutalist View Transitions</em>. I loved this prompt, since I have always been interested in brutalism, and instantly had some cool ideas of how to implement this into this website.\n\nI started out analysing the prompt. I did end up kind of ignoring the glitzy part, leaning into brutalism. So what does brutalism mean? In architecture it's raw materials, visible structure, and no unnecessary decorations. When you look at brutalism in webdesign, it tends to be mostly black and white, with one or two colors as accent, simple fonts, often big headings, minimal to no decorative elements.\n\nSo how do I translate this to a view transition? I decided to go big and bold, and created an interactive screen with `P5.js` and the <a href=\"https://p5-svelte.netlify.app/\">svelte library</a>.

I started small, adding an animated active state indicator to the menu item using the `::before` pseudo-element. To my surprise, it was super straightforward:\n\n```css\n.active::before {\n  view-transition-name: active-link;\n}\n```\n\nThat one line already gave me a nice animation between active links—way easier than I expected, and a fun first win before tackling the more complex stuff.\n\n\nOnce I got the hang of basic transitions, I deciced to dive into the transition I had in mind. I turned the interactive graphic into a component, and imported it in the `Layout.svelte`. Here I used a boolean variable called `isTransitioning` to toggle it's visibility during page transitions. This component fades in when a transition is happening, and fades out when it's done. It sits on top of everything with `position: fixed`. \n\nI used a boolean variable called `isTransitioning` to toggle its visibility during page transitions.

This allows for a dynamic way to target and style elements based on their position, without any JS, hacky CSS `.first` classes or manual `--index` custom properties needed! 🎉 `sibling-index()` does this in a way more elegant way.\n\n## Use Case: Staggered Animations\n\nI have used `sibling-index()` to add a delay on the animations of my work showcase.\n\nOn each list item we calculate a custom delay, based on it's index in the list.\n\n```css\nli {\n  --delay: calc((sibling-index() + 1) * 0.25s);\n  animation: fade-slide-in 0.75s var(--delay) ease-in-out both;\n}\n```\n\n*Note: I'm still trying to figure out a way to delay this completely until it's in the viewport but its a struggle.

You can use it to give each item a different color, using it to calculate a custom gradient, or even use it to make a custom cursor. It's a very versatile tool, and I'm sure it will be used in many different ways in the future.

While building the new version of my website, I got to implement this new feature. This is an extension upon the container queries, to track the state of an element and figure out if it's scrolling or sticky somewhere. This allows us to add an animation or styling when an element is sticky at the top, like a `nav` for example.\n\n## Header and Nav\n\nI started out with a regular sticky header, which contains a nav element.\n\n```css\nheader {\n  position: sticky;\n  top: 0;\n}\n\nnav {\n  width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nTo prevent issues on browsers that do not support this feature, I've wrapped the CSS for this in an `@supports` query.\n\n```css\n@supports (container-type: scroll-state) {\n  header {\n    container-type: scroll-state;\n    container-name: header;\n  }\n\n  nav {\n    width: 100%;\n    max-width: 65rem;\n    border-radius: 0;\n    box-shadow: 0 0px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then the part that makes the magic work: `@container scroll-state(stuck: top)`. This waits for the header to be stuck at the top of the page. Within this query I have added the different styling for the nav.\n\n```css\n@container scroll-state(stuck: top) {\n  nav {\n    background: linear-gradient(0deg, transparent 0%, var(--white) 90%);\n    border-radius: 0 0 12px 12px;\n    backdrop-filter: blur(1px);\n    -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(5px);\n    box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis was way easier than I expected it to be.

wat debouncing is en hoe ik heb toegepast in een project tijdens mijn stage.\n\n## ComboBox.svelte\n\nDit component laat gebruikers een prijs range invoeren of selecteren, om alleen items te zien die binnen deze range vallen. De gebruiker kan ook alleen een minimale of maximale prijs invoeren.\n\nWanneer een gebruiker focust op een input veld, verschijnt de bijbehorende `<div>` met suggesties. Als in het andere input veld al een waarde geselecteerd is, krijg je hier alleen suggesties te zien die groter/kleiner zijn dan die waarde.\n\nIk heb bij dit component een debounce functie gebruikt om onnodige re-renders en errors te voorkomen.\n\n## Debounce\n\n### Wat is debouncing?\n\nDebouncing is een techniek waarbij een functie pas wordt uitgevoerd na een korte vertraging nadat de gebruiker stopt met typen. Dit voorkomt dat de functie telkens wordt aangeroepen tijdens het typen. Dit word vaak gebruikt bij searchbars of filters.\n\nIk gebruik in dit component debouncing om de filter logica pas uit te voeren nadat de gebruiker stopt met typen.\n\nDit is de debounce functie:\n\n```js\nlet debounceMinTimer;\nlet debounceMaxTimer;\n\nconst debounceMin = (value) => {\n  clearTimeout(debounceMinTimer); // Annuleer een eventuele vorige timer\n\n  debounceMinTimer = setTimeout(() => {\n    const numValue = Number(value);\n\n    if (selectedMaxValue && numValue >= 0 && numValue <= selectedMaxValue) {\n      tempMinValue = numValue; // Bijwerken van de minimumwaarde\n      checkPriceValidity(); // Controleer of de prijzen geldig zijn\n    }\n  }, 500); // Debounce tijd van 500ms\n};\n\nconst debounceMax = (value) => {\n  clearTimeout(debounceMaxTimer); // Annuleer een eventuele vorige timer\n\n  debounceMaxTimer = setTimeout(() => {\n    const numValue = Number(value);\n\n    if (numValue >= tempMinValue) {\n      tempMaxValue = numValue; // Bijwerken van de maximumwaarde\n      checkPriceValidity(); // Controleer of de prijzen geldig zijn\n    }\n  }, 500); // Debounce tijd van 500ms\n};\n```\n\n### Hoe werkt debouncing?\n\nElke keer dat de gebruiker typt, wordt de vorige timer (als die bestaat) geannuleerd met `clearTimeout(debounceMinTimer)` of `clearTimeout(debounceMaxTimer)`. Dit voorkomt dat de filter functie te vaak wordt uitgevoerd.\n\nDaarna word een nieuwe timer ingesteld, die na 500ms de filterfunctie uitvoert. Dit betekent dat de filtering pas plaatsvindt als de gebruik een halve seconde niks heeft ingevoerd in het input veld. Dit wordt aangeroepen op de `<input>` met `onkeyup`:\n\n`onkeyup={(e) => debounceMin(e.target.value)}`\n\nDus een halve seconde nadat de gebruiker een toets omhoog laat komen, wordt de filtering uitgevoerd.\n\nHierna wordt gecontroleerd of de ingevoerde minimum- en maximumprijs een geldige range zijn. De maximum prijs mag niet kleiner zijn dan de minimum prijs, en andersom.\n\n### Waarom heb ik het gebruikt?\n\nIk heb hier debouncing gebruikt, omdat wanneer ik begon met typen, de getypte waarde meteen vergeleken werd met de geselecteerde minimum prijs. Dus als ik €1000 geselecteerd heb voor de minimum prijs, en €5000 wil typen voor de maximum prijs, kreeg ik al een error na het typen van 5. Als deze error eenmaal in beeld kwam, zat ik vast. Wat ik verder type werd niet meer geupdate, ik kon de filter niet resetten, en moest de pagina refreshen om het opnieuw te proberen. Hier zou een gebruiker dus vast zitten.\n\nDit is geen gebruiksvriendelijke ervaring. Daarnaast werd de functie hier constant aangeroepen, wat voor overbodige re-renders zou kunnen zorgen, wat de performance zou kunnen beïnvloeden.\n\nIn [deze issue](https://github.com/users/lisagjh/projects/13/views/14?pane=issue&itemId=106915336&issue=lisagjh%7Ci-love-web%7C211) heb ik het voor het eerst toegepast, en in [deze issue](https://github.com/users/lisagjh/projects/13/views/14?pane=issue&itemId=107444261&issue=lisagjh%7Ci-love-web%7C215) heb ik de debouncing iets verbeterd. [Hier](https://svelte.dev/playground/f55e23d0bf4b43b1a221cf8b88ef9904?version=5.27.1#H4sIAAAAAAAAE22OTWrDMBCFrzLMJjaYxt0qtiFQeoLuqi4Ue1JE5bGxRm6D0N2LnJp20eX73g8vIpuRUOETXabAPcFz4MGMxGKcxwqv1pFH9RpRbnMOZoDVXjvP84NfyUlmF-PpP95PLMTiUWHj-8XO0mnW4khgNa49HE67FDvSkhVr6Sf2AsP-q4UV2g5itrT0jszyYkeaghRbqzzdnU1AC55k94vyT1PLalxe-8mnCh7rur7Xk-bm-HuRG8tzEJhYfdAtzG0sIohZ3kkUxHw-ECRI2_7-tNhwmeDYaY6rcQkrFPoSVLIESm8VirHu0_KA6mqcp_QNViAcLIYBAAA=) kan je een duidelijk en kort voorbeeld van debouncing in Svelte zien.\n\n## Conclusie\n\nDe debouncing techniek zorgt hier voor een fijne gebruikerservaring. Door de filtering pas uit te voeren nadat de gebruiker stopt met typen, worden onnodige herberekingen en re-renders voorkomen, en word er voorkomen dat de gebruiker vast komt te zitten op een error die te vroeg in beeld komt.","src/content/blog/debounce.md","453482d9c1afbecc",{html:198,metadata:199},"<h1 id=\"debouncing\">Debouncing</h1>\n<p>In deze post leg ik uit wat debouncing is en hoe ik heb toegepast in een project tijdens mijn stage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"comboboxsvelte\">ComboBox.svelte</h2>\n<p>Dit component laat gebruikers een prijs range invoeren of selecteren, om alleen items te zien die binnen deze range vallen.

Dit voorkomt dat de filter functie te vaak wordt uitgevoerd.</p>\n<p>Daarna word een nieuwe timer ingesteld, die na 500ms de filterfunctie uitvoert. Dit betekent dat de filtering pas plaatsvindt als de gebruik een halve seconde niks heeft ingevoerd in het input veld. Dit wordt aangeroepen op de <code>&#x3C;input></code> met <code>onkeyup</code>:</p>\n<p><code>onkeyup={(e) => debounceMin(e.target.value)}</code></p>\n<p>Dus een halve seconde nadat de gebruiker een toets omhoog laat komen, wordt de filtering uitgevoerd.</p>\n<p>Hierna wordt gecontroleerd of de ingevoerde minimum- en maximumprijs een geldige range zijn. De maximum prijs mag niet kleiner zijn dan de minimum prijs, en andersom.</p>\n<h3 id=\"waarom-heb-ik-het-gebruikt\">Waarom heb ik het gebruikt?</h3>\n<p>Ik heb hier debouncing gebruikt, omdat wanneer ik begon met typen, de getypte waarde meteen vergeleken werd met de geselecteerde minimum prijs. Dus als ik €1000 geselecteerd heb voor de minimum prijs, en €5000 wil typen voor de maximum prijs, kreeg ik al een error na het typen van 5. Als deze error eenmaal in beeld kwam, zat ik vast. Wat ik verder type werd niet meer geupdate, ik kon de filter niet resetten, en moest de pagina refreshen om het opnieuw te proberen. Hier zou een gebruiker dus vast zitten.</p>\n<p>Dit is geen gebruiksvriendelijke ervaring. Daarnaast werd de functie hier constant aangeroepen, wat voor overbodige re-renders zou kunnen zorgen, wat de performance zou kunnen beïnvloeden.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/users/lisagjh/projects/13/views/14?pane=issue&#x26;itemId=106915336&#x26;issue=lisagjh%7Ci-love-web%7C211\">deze issue</a> heb ik het voor het eerst toegepast, en in <a href=\"https://github.com/users/lisagjh/projects/13/views/14?pane=issue&#x26;itemId=107444261&#x26;issue=lisagjh%7Ci-love-web%7C215\">deze issue</a> heb ik de debouncing iets verbeterd. <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/playground/f55e23d0bf4b43b1a221cf8b88ef9904?version=5.27.1#H4sIAAAAAAAAE22OTWrDMBCFrzLMJjaYxt0qtiFQeoLuqi4Ue1JE5bGxRm6D0N2LnJp20eX73g8vIpuRUOETXabAPcFz4MGMxGKcxwqv1pFH9RpRbnMOZoDVXjvP84NfyUlmF-PpP95PLMTiUWHj-8XO0mnW4khgNa49HE67FDvSkhVr6Sf2AsP-q4UV2g5itrT0jszyYkeaghRbqzzdnU1AC55k94vyT1PLalxe-8mnCh7rur7Xk-bm-HuRG8tzEJhYfdAtzG0sIohZ3kkUxHw-ECRI2_7-tNhwmeDYaY6rcQkrFPoSVLIESm8VirHu0_KA6mqcp_QNViAcLIYBAAA=\">Hier</a> kan je een duidelijk en kort voorbeeld van debouncing in Svelte zien.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusie\">Conclusie</h2>\n<p>De debouncing techniek zorgt hier voor een fijne gebruikerservaring.

Het word vooral veel gebruikt met populaire CMS'en: WordPress, Drupal, Joomla.\nOok is veel van de underlying code van WooCommerce and Magento gebaseerd op PHP.\n\nPHP heeft veel built-in functionaliteit voor interactie met data. Vanilla PHP alleen kan ook gebruikt worden om web app backends te bouwen. Maar er zijn ook verschillende krachtige frameworks: Laravel, CakePHP, Symfony.\n\n## How is PHP used in HTML?\n\nPHP word gebruikt om dynamische web pages te bouwen.\n\nPHP is ontworpen om goed samen te werken met HTML, waardoor het in-line gebruikt kan worden in een HTML document. Als de website gerendered word, word de PHP uitgevoerd, en als HTML toegevoegd.\n\nHet begin van een PHP line start met: `<?php` en eindigt met `?>`. Bijvoorbeeld:\n\n```html\n<p>This HTML will get delivered as is</p>\n<?php echo \"<p>But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML</p>\";?>\n\n```\n\nIn PHP, wordt het `echo` keyword gebruikt voor output text. De tekst in dit geval is alles tussen de `\"aanhalingstekens\"` . Een instructie die in PHP is geschreven heeft een `statement`. Een semicolon `;` is required aan het eind van elk statement.\n\n## How is PHP executed?\n\nPHP kan niet alleen gebruikt worden om dynamische HTML te genereren, maar ook als programmeertaal via de terminal. Wanneer je een PHP-script schrijft, begin je ook altijd met `<?php`, maar de afsluitende tag is meestal niet nodig, en word als conventie vaak weg gelaten.\n\nPHP negeert witruimte, en is deels niet hoofdlettergevoelig – bijvoorbeeld, `echo` en `Echo` werken beide. Toch is het aangeraden om de standaard schrijfwijze (`echo`) te gebruiken.\n\n## PHP comments\n\nEr zijn twee manieren om comments te gebruiken in PHP. De eerste is `single line comments`. Hier word `#` of `//` gebruikt.\n\nDe tweede soort is een `multi line comment`. Hier gebruik je `/* comment */` om meerdere lines of code uit te commenten.\n\n### Voorbeeld - Todo list\n\nDe Todo list is een goed voorbeeld, omdat hier de CRUD behaviors worden gebruikt - create, read, update, delete.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\n// Verbinding maken met de database\n$pdo = new \\PDO(\"sqlite:\" . \"db/sqlite.db\");\n\n// Nieuwe TODO aanmaken\nif (isset($_POST['submit'])) {\n    $description = $_POST['description'];\n    $sth = $pdo->prepare(\"INSERT INTO todos (description) VALUES (:description)\");\n    $sth->bindValue(':description', $description, PDO::PARAM_STR);\n    $sth->execute();\n}\n\n// TODO verwijderen\nelseif (isset($_POST['delete'])) {\n    $id = $_POST['id'];\n    $sth = $pdo->prepare(\"DELETE FROM todos WHERE id = :id\");\n    $sth->bindValue(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);\n    $sth->execute();\n}\n\n// TODO markeren als compleet\nelseif (isset($_POST['complete'])) {\n    $id = $_POST['id'];\n    $sth = $pdo->prepare(\"UPDATE todos SET complete = 1 WHERE id = :id\");\n    $sth->bindValue(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_INT);\n    $sth->execute();\n}\n?>\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Todo List</title>\n</head>\n<body class=\"container\">\n    <h1>Todo List</h1>\n\n    <form method=\"post\" action=\"\">\n        <input type=\"text\" name=\"description\" value=\"\">\n        <input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" value=\"Add\">\n    </form>\n\n    <h2>Current Todos</h2>\n\n    <table class=\"table table-striped\">\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Task</th>\n                <th></th>\n                <th></th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            <?php\n            $sth = $pdo->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM todos ORDER BY id DESC\");\n            $sth->execute();\n\n            foreach ($sth as $row): ?>\n                <tr>\n                    <td><?= htmlspecialchars($row['description']) ?></td>\n                    <td>\n                        <?php if (!$row['complete']): ?>\n                            <form method=\"POST\">\n                                <button type=\"submit\" name=\"complete\">Complete</button>\n                                <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"id\" value=\"<?= $row['id'] ?>\">\n                                <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"complete\" value=\"true\">\n                            </form>\n                        <?php else: ?>\n                            Task Complete!\n                        <?php endif; ?>\n                    </td>\n                    <td>\n                        <form method=\"POST\">\n                            <button type=\"submit\" name=\"delete\">Delete</button>\n                            <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"id\" value=\"<?= $row['id'] ?>\">\n                            <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"delete\" value=\"true\">\n                        </form>\n                    </td>\n                </tr>\n            <?php endforeach; ?>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n```\n\n# PHP strings & variables\n\n- String: woorden of stukken tekst die door de computer worden gezien als een item. Een string is een reeks karakters, tussen `\"quotation marks\"`.\n\n```php\n<?php\necho \"Hello World!\" ;\n```\n\nHet is belangrijk om duidelijk te maken wat een string is en wat niet in een PHP program. Elk deel van de code is tekst, maar de strings zijn data - deze moeten niet uitgevoerd worden door de computer.\n\n## Escape Sequences\n\nAan het begin en eind van een string gebruiken we aanhalingstekens. Deze laten de computer weten dat alles daar tussen een stukje data is.\n\nAls je binnen die string iets tussen aanhalingstekens zet, herkent PHP dit niet en krijg je een syntax error.\n\n```php\necho \"She said \"hi\" to the dog.\"; //syntax error, unexpected 'hi' (T_STRING)\n```\n\nDit kan je oplossen door `\\` backslashes om het deel van de string te zetten met de aanhalingstekens. Dit noem je een _escape sequence_.\n\nBij het printen van meerdere strings heb je ook een escape sequence nodig:\n\n```php\necho \"1. Go to gym\";\necho \"2. Cook dinner\";\n\n/* output:\n1. Go to gym2. Cook dinner\n*/\n```\n\nHier kun je `\\n` er voor zetten, om aan te geven dat het op een nieuwe regel moet staan:\n\n```php\necho \"1. Go to gym\";\necho \"\\n2. Cook dinner\";\n\n1. Go to gym\n2. Cook dinner\n*/\n```\n\n```php\necho \"1. Teach PHP\";\necho \"\\n2. Something else\";\necho \"\\n3. Learn to have \\\"fun\\\"\";\n```\n\n## String Concatenation\n\n```php\necho \"Code\" . \"cademy\";\necho \"\\nMy name is:\" . \" \" . \"Lisa\";\necho \"\\n\" . \"tur\" . \"duck\" . \"en\";\n```\n\n## Variables\n\nIn PHP gebruik je het `$` teken om een variabele te definiëren. Variable names kunnen nummers, letters en underscores (`_`) bevatten, maar moeten altijd beginnen met een letter of underscore. De variable names zijn case sensitive, dus `$my_example` en `$My_example` worden als twee verschillende variables gezien.\n\nEen veel gebruikte conventie bij benaming is het gebruik van een underscore tussen twee woorden, oftewel `snake_case`.\n\n```php\n$name = \"Lisa\";\n$language = \"php\";\n\necho \"I am\" . $name;\necho \"\\n\" . $language\n```\n\n### Variable parsing\n\n```php\n$dog_name = \"Tadpole\";\n$favorite_food = \"salmon\";\n$color = \"brown\";\n\necho \"I have a $color dog named $dog_name and her favorite food is $favorite_food.\";\n// Prints: I have a brown dog named Tadpole and her favorite food is salmon.\n```\n\n#### curly braces\n\nDit voorbeeld geeft een error, omdat `toys` niet bestaat.\n\n```php\n$toy = \"frisbee\";\necho \"Alex likes playing with $toys\";\n```\n\nAls je achter de variable iets wilt zetten, kan je de variabele in curly braces wrappen – `${variable}`. Alles wat er dan direct achter staat word er aan geplakt.\n\n```php\n$dog_name = \"Tadpole\";\n$favorite_food = \"treat\";\n$color = \"brown\";\n\necho \"I have a ${color}ish dog named $dog_name and her favorite food is ${favorite_food}s.\";\n// Prints: I have a brownish dog named Tadpole and her favorite food is treats.\n```\n\n## Concatenating Assignment Operator\n\n```php\n$sentence = \"\\nI'm going on a picnic, and I'm taking apples\";\n$sentence .= \", but also milk\";\n$sentence .= \", cant do nuts though\";\n\necho $sentence;\n// Prints: I'm going on a picnic, and I'm taking apples, but also milk, cant do nuts though\n```\n\n## Assign by Reference\n\nWanneer we een variabele toewijzen aan een andere variabele, reserveert de computer een nieuw stukje geheugen dat wordt gekoppeld aan de linkeroperand, en slaat daar een kopie op van de waarde van de rechteroperand.\n\nDe nieuwe variabele is een kopie van de waarde van de originele variabele, maar het is een onafhankelijke variabele; verandering bij de een heeft geen invloed op de ander.\n\n**Voorbeeld:**\n\n```php\n$first_player_rank = \"Beginner\";\n$second_player_rank = $first_player_rank;\necho $second_player_rank; // Prints: Beginner\n\n$first_player_rank = \"Intermediate\"; // Reassign the value of $first_player_rank\necho $second_player_rank; // Still Prints: Beginner\n```\n\nJe kan ook een alias maken, een bijnaam. In plaats van een kopie van de originele variabele waarde, maken we een nieuwe naam die naar de zelfde plek in het geheugen verwijst. Hier word een andere operator voor gebruikt, de reference assignment oeprator – `=&`.\n\nAls we \"assign by reference\" gebruiken, zeggen we dat de variabele aan de linker kant van de operator verwijzen naar exact dezelfde data als de variabele rechts. Met assignment by reference, veranderingen aan de ene variabele hebben wel invloed op de ander.\n\n**Voorbeeld:**\n\n```php\n$first_player_rank = \"Beginner\";\n$second_player_rank =& $first_player_rank;\necho $second_player_rank; // Prints: Beginner\n\n$first_player_rank = \"Intermediate\"; // Reassign the value of $first_player_rank\necho $second_player_rank; // Prints: Intermediate\n\n```\n\n**Voorbeeld assign by reference:**\n\n```php\n/* Imagine a lot of code here */\n$very_bad_unclear_name = \"15 chicken wings\";\n\n$order =& $very_bad_unclear_name;\n$order .= \", 3 nuggets\";\necho \"\\nYour order is: $very_bad_unclear_name.\";\n\n// Your order is: 15 chicken wings, 3 nuggets.\n```\n\n```php\n$name = \"Tadpole\";\n$title = \", Princess of Dogulon\";\n$name .= $title;\necho $name;\n```\n\n---\n\n# Numbers\n\nPHP heeft twee nummer data types. De `integer` data type is een heel positief of negatief nummers (3, 4500, -98, 0). De `floating point` data type is decimale nummers (4.1, 2.999, -9.2, -1827.98)\n\n```php\n$my_int = 78;\n$my_float = 89.9;\n\necho $my_int; // Prints: 78\necho \"\\n\"; // new line\necho $my_float; // Prints 89.9\n```\n\nEr zijn ook verschillende operators die we kunnen gebruiken.\n\n```php\necho 5 + 1; // Prints: 6\necho 6.6 + 1.2; // Prints: 7.8\necho 198263 - 263;  // Prints: 198000\necho -22.8 - 19.1; // Prints: -41.9\n```\n\nOp deze manier kunnen we ook rekenen met variabelen:\n\n```php\n$tadpole_age = 7;\n$lily_age = 6;\n$age_difference = $tadpole_age - $lily_age;\necho $age_difference; // Prints 1\n```\n\nEn ook delen en keer\n\n```php\n$num_languages = 4;\n$months = 11;\n$days = $months * 16;\n\n$days_per_language = $days / $num_languages;\n\necho $days_per_language;\n```\n\nMaar ook een exponentiation operatotr – `**`.\n\n```php\necho 4 ** 2; // Prints: 16`\n```\n\nDit kan op floats en negatieve nummers ook gebruikt worden\n\n```php\necho 2.89 ** 3.2;  // Prints: 29.845104015297\necho 10 ** -1; // Prints: 0.1\n```\n\nEn de modula operator – `%`. Deze operator returns de remainder, het overblijfsel van de linker operand gedeeld door de rechter operand.\n\n```php\necho 7 % 3; // Prints: 1\n```\n\nJe kan ook bepaalde sommen tussen haakjes zetten.\n\n```php\necho 94 - 4.25 + 7 - (23.50 * 1.2) + (20 / 4);\n```\n\nDe volgorde van de operations word zo bepaald:\n\n1. Any operation wrapped in parentheses (`()`)\n2. Exponents (`**`)\n3. Multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`)\n4. Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).\n\nThe acronym PEMDAS can be helpful for remembering the order of precedence for these arithmetic operations.\n\n### Tabel\n\n| **Operation**  | **Symbol** | **Example**        | **Output** |\n| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------ | ---------- |\n| Addition       | `+`        | `echo 1 + 4.5;`    | 5.5        |\n| Subtraction    | `-`        | `echo 9 - 1;`      | 8          |\n| Multiplication | `*`        | `echo -1.9 * 2.9;` | -5.51      |\n| Division       | `/`        | `echo 9 / 1;`      | 9          |\n| Modulo         | `%`        | `echo 11 % 3;`     | 2          |\n| Exponentiation | `**`       | `echo 8 ** 2;`     | 64         |\n\n## Mathematical Assignment Operators\n\n```php\n$savings = 800;\n$bike_cost = 75;\n$savings = $savings - $bike_cost;\necho $savings; // Prints: 725\n\n// kan korter!

Als er dan geen argument word meegegeven als de functie invoked word, word deze gebruikt. Als er wel een argument word meegegeven, word deze overschreven.\n\n```php\nfunction greetFriend($name = \"old chum\")\n{\n  echo \"Hello, $name!\";\n};\n\ngreetFriend(\"Marvin\"); // Prints: Hello, Marvin!\n\ngreetFriend(); // Prints: Hello, old chum!\n```\n\n### Pass by Reference\n\nWe kunnen functions met variables aanroepen of met directe waardes. Als we een function invoken met een variable als argument, is het alsof we die waarde toewijzen aan de function's parameter. We wijzen een kopie van de waarde van de argument variable toe. Het variable argument en de parameter zijn aparte entities; verandering aan de parameter in de functie heeft geen effect op de waarde die gepassed is.\n\n```php\nfunction addX ($param)\n{\n  $param = $param . \"X\";\n  echo $param;\n};\n$word = \"Hello\";\naddX($word); // Prints: HelloX\necho $word; // Prints: Hello\n```\n\nAls we wel permanent een variabele willen veranderen, daan zetten we een `&` voor de parameter argument van de functie.\n\n```php\nfunction addXPermanently (&$param)\n{\n  $param = $param . \"X\";\n  echo $param;\n};\n$word = \"Hello\";\naddXPermanently($word); // Prints: HelloX\necho $word; // Prints: HelloX\n```\n\n**Voorbeeld**\n\n```php\n$string_one = \"you have teeth\";\n$string_two = \"toads are nice\";\n$string_three = \"brown is my favorite color\";\n\nfunction convertToQuestion(&$str) // gebruik van &\n{\n$str = \"Do you think \" . $str . \"?\\n\";\n// redefinieren van string argument\n}\n\n// in de console de nieuwe string variabele\necho convertToQuestion($string_one);\necho convertToQuestion($string_two);\necho convertToQuestion($string_three)\n```\n\n### Variable Scope\n\n```php\nfunction calculateDaysLeft($feed_quantity, $number, $rate)\n{\n  $result = $feed_quantity / ($number * $rate);\n  return $result;\n}\n\necho calculateDaysLeft(300, 2, 30);\n```\n\n## Introduction to Built-In Functions\n\nPHP heeft een aantal built-in functions. Deze functies – ook bekend als internal functions – kunnen aangeroepen worden zonder dat wij ze zelf te hoeven schrijven.\n\n```php\necho(\"This works!\\n\");\necho \"This also works!\\n\";\necho \"Buuuut!\", \" \", \"This\", \" \", \"does!\", \"\\n\";\n//echo(\"This would NOT work\", \"\\n\");\n```\n\n### Werken met Variables\n\nPHP heeft een handige built-in function voor het verkrijgen van informatie over de variables, zoals `gettype()`. Deze functie neemt een argument en returned een string waarde die aangeeft wat voor data type het argument is.\n\n```php\n$name = \"Aisle Nevertell\";\n$age = 1000000;\n\necho gettype($name); // Prints: string\necho gettype($age); // Prints: integer\n```\n\nEen andere functie die ook een variabele argument gebruikt is de `var_dump()` functie. Het print details over het argument dat het krijgt. Het laat zien wat voor soort data type het is, en welke waarde het heeft. Voor een string laat het de lengte hiervan zien.\n\n```php\nvar_dump($name); // Prints: string(15) \"Aisle Nevertell\"\nvar_dump($age); // Prints: int(1000000)\n```\n\n`strrev()` krijgt een argument, een string, en draait deze om.\n\n```php\necho strrev(\"Hello, World!\"); // Prints: !dlroW ,olleH\n```\n\n`strtolower()` transformeert de argument string naar alleen kleine letters.\n\n```php\necho strtolower(\"HeLLo\"); // Prints: hello\n```\n\n`strrepeat()` neemt een string als eerste argument, en een nummer als het tweede. Het returned een string die de argument string zo vaak herhaald als het argument nummer.\n\n```php\necho str_repeat(\"hi\", 10); // Prints: hihihihihihihihihihi\n```\n\n### Werken met Substrings\n\nEen substring is een deel van een string. `substr_count()` is een functie die de hoeveelheid substrings in een string returned. Het neemt twee argumenten; de string die doorzocht word, en de substring die gezocht word — soms ook de `neelde` genoemd.\n\n```php\n$story = \"I was like, \\\"Dude, like just tell me what you like think because like everyone else is like being totally honest, and like I just want to know what you like think.\\\" So like I don't know...\";\n\necho substr_count($story, \"like\"); // Prints: 8\n```\n\n#### Bronnen\n\n- [Officiële PHP docs](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php)\n- [Variables - codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php/variables)\n- [PHP functions](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/php/functions)\n- [Introduction to functions - cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-php-functions/modules/introduction-to-functions-in-php/cheatsheet)","src/content/blog/learn-php.md","82456c5f602dfde0",{html:240,metadata:241},"<h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#introduction-to-php\">Introduction to PHP</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#history-of-php\">History of PHP</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-is-php-used-in-html\">How is PHP used in HTML?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#how-is-php-executed\">How is PHP executed?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#php-comments\">PHP comments</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#voorbeeld---todo-list\">Example - Todo list</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#php-strings--variables\">PHP strings &#x26; variables</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#escape-sequences\">Escape Sequences</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#string-concatenation\">String Concatenation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#variables\">Variables</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#variable-parsing\">Variable parsing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#curly-braces\">Curly braces</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#concatenating-assignment-operator\">Concatenating Assignment Operator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#assign-by-reference\">Assign by Reference</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#numbers\">Numbers</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#mathematical-assignment-operators\">Mathematical Assignment Operators</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tabel-overzicht-operators\">Table Overview Operators</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#php-functions\">PHP Functions</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#introduction-to-functions\">Introduction to Functions</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#multiple-parameters\">Multiple Parameters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#default-parameters\">Default Parameters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#pass-by-reference\">Pass by Reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#variable-scope\">Variable Scope</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#introduction-to-built-in-functions\">Introduction to Built-In Functions</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#werken-met-variables\">Working with Variables</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#werken-met-substrings\">Working with Substrings</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#bronnen\">Bronnen</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"introduction-to-php\">Introduction to PHP</h1>\n<h2 id=\"history-of-php\">History of PHP</h2>\n<p>In 1994 is PHP gecreeërd.</p>\n<p>PHP is een van de fundamentele technologieën van web development, en een van de meest gebruikte server side technologieën. Het word vooral veel gebruikt met populaire CMS’en: WordPress, Drupal, Joomla.\nOok is veel van de underlying code van WooCommerce and Magento gebaseerd op PHP.</p>\n<p>PHP heeft veel built-in functionaliteit voor interactie met data. Vanilla PHP alleen kan ook gebruikt worden om web app backends te bouwen. Maar er zijn ook verschillende krachtige frameworks: Laravel, CakePHP, Symfony.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-php-used-in-html\">How is PHP used in HTML?</h2>\n<p>PHP word gebruikt om dynamische web pages te bouwen.</p>\n<p>PHP is ontworpen om goed samen te werken met HTML, waardoor het in-line gebruikt kan worden in een HTML document. Als de website gerendered word, word de PHP uitgevoerd, en als HTML toegevoegd.</p>\n<p>Het begin van een PHP line start met: <code>&#x3C;?php</code> en eindigt met <code>?></code>. Bijvoorbeeld:</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"html\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">&#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#85E89D\">p</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">>This HTML will get delivered as is&#x3C;/</span><span style=\"color:#85E89D\">p</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#FDAEB7;font-style:italic\">&#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">?php echo \"&#x3C;</span><span style=\"color:#85E89D\">p</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">>But this code is interpreted by PHP and turned into HTML&#x3C;/</span><span style=\"color:#85E89D\">p</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">>\";?></span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span></code></pre>\n<p>In PHP, wordt het <code>echo</code> keyword gebruikt voor output text. De tekst in dit geval is alles tussen de <code>\"aanhalingstekens\"</code> . Een instructie die in PHP is geschreven heeft een <code>statement</code>. Een semicolon <code>;</code> is required aan het eind van elk statement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-php-executed\">How is PHP executed?</h2>\n<p>PHP kan niet alleen gebruikt worden om dynamische HTML te genereren, maar ook als programmeertaal via de terminal. Wanneer je een PHP-script schrijft, begin je ook altijd met <code>&#x3C;?php</code>, maar de afsluitende tag is meestal niet nodig, en word als conventie vaak weg gelaten.</p>\n<p>PHP negeert witruimte, en is deels niet hoofdlettergevoelig – bijvoorbeeld, <code>echo</code> en <code>Echo</code> werken beide. Toch is het aangeraden om de standaard schrijfwijze (<code>echo</code>) te gebruiken.</p>\n<h2 id=\"php-comments\">PHP comments</h2>\n<p>Er zijn twee manieren om comments te gebruiken in PHP. De eerste is <code>single line comments</code>. Hier word <code>#</code> of <code>//</code> gebruikt.</p>\n<p>De tweede soort is een <code>multi line comment</code>. Hier gebruik je <code>/* comment */</code> om meerdere lines of code uit te commenten.</p>\n<h3 id=\"voorbeeld---todo-list\">Voorbeeld - Todo list</h3>\n<p>De Todo list is een goed voorbeeld, omdat hier de CRUD behaviors worden gebruikt - create, read, update, delete.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\"

Variable names kunnen nummers, letters en underscores (<code>_</code>) bevatten, maar moeten altijd beginnen met een letter of underscore. De variable names zijn case sensitive, dus <code>$my_example</code> en <code>$My_example</code> worden als twee verschillende variables gezien.</p>\n<p>Een veel gebruikte conventie bij benaming is het gebruik van een underscore tussen twee woorden, oftewel <code>snake_case</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"php\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$name </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"Lisa\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$language </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"php\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">echo</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"I am\"</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> .</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> $name;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">echo</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"</span><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">\\n</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color:#F97583\"> .</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\"> $language</span></span></code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"variable-parsing\">Variable parsing</h3>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"php\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$dog_name </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"Tadpole\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$favorite_food </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"salmon\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$color </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"brown\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">echo</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"I have a </span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$color</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> dog named </span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$dog_name</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> and her favorite food is </span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$favorite_food</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">.\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#6A737D\">// Prints: I have a brown dog named Tadpole and her favorite food is salmon.</span></span></code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"curly-braces\">curly braces</h4>\n<p>Dit voorbeeld geeft een error, omdat <code>toys</code> niet bestaat.</p>\n<pre class=\"astro-code github-dark\" style=\"background-color:#24292e;color:#e1e4e8; overflow-x: auto;\" tabindex=\"0\" data-language=\"php\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$toy </span><span style=\"color:#F97583\">=</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"frisbee\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color:#79B8FF\">echo</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\"> \"Alex likes playing with </span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">$toys</span><span style=\"color:#9ECBFF\">\"</span><span style=\"color:#E1E4E8\">;</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Als je achter de variable iets wilt zetten, kan je de variabele in curly braces wrappen – <code>${variable}</code>.
