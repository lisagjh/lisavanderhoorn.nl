During my final year at FDND, I worked on this project with two classmates. It was a collaboration with [De Voorhoede](https://www.voorhoede.nl/nl/), who developed the actual new website for [Dutch Digital Agencies](https://dutchdigitalagencies.com/). We had the chance to work directly with their team lead, Declan, an expert in his field. Each sprint review, he gave us valuable feedback, which really helped me grow as a developer.

## The Challenge

We were tasked with building the new design of the DDA website. While we had their design as a base, we also had creative freedom to improve and reimagine parts of it.

The main challenge for me was working with SvelteKit and Svelte 5 which had just launched. We were still learning about JavaScript frameworks, so jumping into the latest version was challenging, with lots of unknowns and new concepts to master.

## My Solution

Declan encouraged us to make creative decisions, and I really took that opportunity.

One of my main focuses was the banner carousel on the homepage. The original design made several logos nearly invisible. I designed our version to ensure better contrast and layout, and honestly, I still prefer ours — it's more consistent and accessible.

For the menu, I moved it from the header into a sidebar. The original site used a tiny font size (~12px) to fit everything in, which compromised readability. I prioritized accessibility and usability, and restructured the layout to support that, using a sidebar gave me more space and flexibility. I also think that this gives it a more distinct look.

## The Result

We were able to deliver a new and improved DDA website, and explore different solutions to problems in the original site and design. It was a fun and exciting project, and I learned a lot about working with a new framework, working with other developers, and working with a real client.

## Reflection

I learned a lot about working with frameworks, SvelteKit, and Svelte 5. I also learned about working with new and unfamiliar technology, and reading and using the documentation.

Working with a real client was also a great learning experience.

I finished this project with stronger skills in development, problem solving, accessibility, and collaboration.

It’s also fun to compare our version with the official one. I still stand behind a lot of our choices (even though now, just a few months later, I already see some improvements), and I’m proud of what we built.
